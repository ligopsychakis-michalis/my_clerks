# my_clerks

- My Clerks app loads until 100 random user using infinite scrolling. The starting point is the index.html file. 
- Cards are responsive and their background color stored on localStorage. There is also a "scroll to top" button.
- I used vanilla JS because it's bonus based on the assignment. (I really enjoyed coding in vanilla JS after a long time)
- Hope you like it!
